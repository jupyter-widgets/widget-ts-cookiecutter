Installation
============


The simplest way to install {{ cookiecutter.python_package_name | replace("-", "_") }} is via pip::

    pip install {{ cookiecutter.python_package_name | replace("-", "_") }}

or via conda::

    conda install {{ cookiecutter.python_package_name | replace("-", "_") }}


If you installed via pip, and notebook version < 5.3, you will also have to
install / configure the front-end extension as well. If you are using classic
notebook (as opposed to Jupyterlab), run::

    jupyter nbextension install [--sys-prefix / --user / --system] --py {{ cookiecutter.python_package_name | replace("-", "_") }}

    jupyter nbextension enable [--sys-prefix / --user / --system] --py {{ cookiecutter.python_package_name | replace("-", "_") }}

with the `appropriate flag`_. If you are using Jupyterlab, install the extension
with::

    jupyter labextension install {{ cookiecutter.npm_package_name }}

If you are installing using conda, these commands should be unnecessary, but If
you need to run them the commands should be the same (just make sure you choose the
`--sys-prefix` flag).
